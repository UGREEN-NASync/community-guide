# How to install AdGuard Home on Docker

AdGuard Home is a network-wide DNS server and blocker that filters ads, trackers, and malicious domains at the DNS level ‚Äî before they even reach your devices. It acts as a local DNS resolver, allowing you to:

  - Block ads and trackers on all devices (even smart TVs and game consoles)
  - Monitor and control internet traffic on your network
  - Set parental controls and filtering rules
  - Protect your privacy by avoiding third-party DNS providers

Unlike browser-based ad blockers, AdGuard Home works for all devices on your network ‚Äî with no need to install anything on each one.

## Deploy Container Using Docker Compose

To quickly deploy AdGuard Home on UGREEN NAS, it is recommended to use Docker Compose for project management. This method is suitable when you need to create and manage multiple containers, making containerized management convenient.

### 1. Access the Docker Project Interface

In the UGOS Pro system of UGREEN NAS, open the "Docker" app, click "Project > Create" to start the project creation wizard.

### 2. Configure the Docker Compose File

In the wizard, you'll need to provide a Docker Compose configuration file. Below is the example configuration file for AdGuard Home:

```yml
services:
  adguardhome:
    container_name: adguardhome
    image: adguard/adguardhome:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /volume2/docker/adguardhome/work:/opt/adguardhome/work
      - /volume2/docker/adguardhome/conf:/opt/adguardhome/conf
```

::: details

  - The volumes directive enables persistent storage for AdGuard Home. The local directories `/volume2/docker/adguardhome/work` and `/volume2/docker/adguardhome/conf` on the NAS are mapped to `/opt/adguardhome/work` and `/opt/adguardhome/conf` inside the container. This ensures that all configuration files, logs, and runtime data are stored on the NAS and survive container restarts or updates.
  - The container_name is set to adguardhome, making it easier to manage the container directly using Docker CLI commands like docker restart adguardhome.
  - The image directive specifies the AdGuard Home Docker image. Using the latest tag ensures that the container always pulls the most recent stable version when recreated.
  - The restart policy is set to unless-stopped, which means the container will automatically restart after a crash or reboot, unless you explicitly stop it.
  - The network_mode is set to host, allowing AdGuard Home to bind directly to ports on the NAS‚Äôs network interface. This is required for it to listen on DNS port 53 and handle requests from all devices in your network without complex port forwarding.

### 3. Deploy the Project

Once the deployment is complete, you can access the AdGuard Home web interface by visiting `http://your-nas-name.local:3000` in your browser.

## üõë Preventing Port Conflicts with `dnsmasq`

By default, UGOS uses `dnsmasq` to handle DNS requests, which binds to port `53` on `localhost`. This will conflict with AdGuard Home, which also needs to bind to port `53`.

To resolve this, you need to stop and disable `dnsmasq`:

### Steps to disable `dnsmasq` on UGOS

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq

```

Verify that port 53 is now free

```bash
sudo lsof -i :53

```

If the command returns no output, port 53 is no longer in use. After that you should restart your AdGuard Home container.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disabling dnsmasq may affect other NAS-related DNS services. Make sure that AdGuard Home is configured correctly and starts automatically to replace its functionality.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Configuration of AdGuard Home

After the container starts successfully, open the web interface again by visiting  `http://your-nas-name.local:3000` in your browser.

You will be guided through a short setup wizard. In the wizard:

- Set a username and password for the admin interface.
- Configure which upstream DNS servers to use (e.g., 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8).
- Define the listening interfaces (usually 0.0.0.0 to listen on all).
- Optionally enable DHCP services, if AdGuard Home should manage IPs on your network.
- Review and apply your settings.

Once complete, the dashboard will show DNS statistics and allow further customization like blacklists, rewrites, client rules, and logging.

Make sure to set your router or clients to use your NAS IP as their DNS server so AdGuard Home becomes active in your network.
