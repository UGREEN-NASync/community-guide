# Setting up Nextcloud-AIO
This guide assumes that you have ssh access to your UGreen NAS. It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code to access your servers directories and terminal/CLI. 

The setup process is similar to [Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)](/ugos/install/npm/) and all docker services in general for that matter. 
For more information visit the [nextcloud-aio GitHub repository](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one)

## Instructions
Create a new directory called `nextcloud-aio` within the docker folder and create a new `compose.yaml` file. The docker compose file for nextcloud-aio can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UGREEN-NASync/community-guide/refs/heads/main/docs/ugos/install/nextcloud-aio/compose.yaml). 

::: tip
The name of the folder always dictates the prefix that docker specifies for all things automatically created, e.g. volumes, networks, service names (unless specified otherwise). 
:::

Save the compose file, right click the `nextcloud-aio` folder in the VSCode Explorer and choose `Open in integrated terminal`. 
Launch the container by executing 

```sh
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Next navigate to your reverse proxy setup (i.e. NPM) and add a new proxy host. 
Enter `nextcloud.YOURDOMAIN.com` as your domain name, type in your servers local IP address in the IP address and type in port `11000` (this is the Apache port made available by nextlcoud-aio). 
In NPM enable `Block common exploits` and `Websocket support`. Navigate to the SSL tab and enable all options and select your wildcard certificate that you created previously. 
Finally navigate to the advanced tab and paste in the following 

```yaml
client_body_buffer_size 512k;
proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
client_max_body_size 0;
```

Next, navigate to your nextcloud domain (i.e. nextcloud.YOURDOMAIN.com) and follow the setup instructions **carefully**. 
Once your nextcloud instance is running, access the `config.php` by executing 

```sh
sudo docker run -it --rm --volume nextcloud_aio_nextcloud:/var/www/html:rw alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache nano && nano /var/www/html/config/config.php"
```

Change or add the following parameters in the `config.php`. 
A list with all available parameters can be found in the [Nextcloud docs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html). 

```php
  'default_phone_region' => 'DE', # your locale, i.e. 'EN' according to ISO 3166-1 A-2
  'maintenance_window_start' => 5, # UTC Hour for maintenance windows
  'default_locale' => 'de_DE', # your locale, i.e. 'en_US' according to ISO 639 language codes AND ISO-3166 country codes
  'default_timezone' => 'Europe/Berlin', # your timezone, i.e. 'America/Chicago' or 'America/New_York'
  'system_addressbook_exposed' => 'no', # OPTIONAL to disable system addressbook
```
