# How to Create a Sector-by-Sector Backup with Clonezilla

This guide explains how to safely create a sector-by-sector backup of your disk using Clonezilla.

## Creating a Bootable Clonezilla USB Stick

Before proceeding with the backup, you need to create a bootable Clonezilla USB stick.

### Steps to Create a Bootable USB Stick:
1. Download the latest **Clonezilla Live ISO** from the [official website](https://clonezilla.org/downloads.php).
2. Use a tool such as **Rufus**, **Balena Etcher**, or **Tuxboot** to create a bootable USB.
3. Insert your USB drive and select the downloaded ISO as the source.
4. Start the process and wait for it to complete.

You now have a bootable Clonezilla USB stick and can proceed with the backup.

## Booting to Clonezilla

Refer to the [Accessing BIOS](/advanced-guides/accessing-bios.md) guide for detailed instructions on how to access and configure your BIOS settings. Once in the BIOS, set the USB stick as the first boot device, save changes, and restart your computer.

Once Clonezilla boots, follow the backup instructions below.
